 * modify network sniffer to gather in and out data separately
 * write read_conf to read in the system configuration from file (mainly timeouts for each gather process)
 * write gather methods -- should be infinite and gather data every defined number of seconds
 * write global gather method which will run gather methods in separate threads and write down data to some file
 * roughly: analize gathered data
